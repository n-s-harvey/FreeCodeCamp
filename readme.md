### Cash Register
This project models a cash transaction and a register - it accepts the price of a product, the cash paid, and the cash in drawer. Check out the [source code](/02_JavaScript_Algorithm_and_Data_Structures/09_Projects/05_cash_register.js) and [my reflections](/02_JavaScript_Algorithm_and_Data_Structures/09_Projects/05_cash_register-thoughts.md).
